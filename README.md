<Abstract>

In this project, we will anaylize WPRDC datasets on the different neighborhoods in Pittsburgh to find the "best" neighborhood. We define the "best" neighborhood in Pittsburgh as the safest one. We consider safety to be measured by three different metrics: crime, speeding, and fire incidents.

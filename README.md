In this project, we analyzed WPRDC datasets on the different neighborhoods in Pittsburgh to find the "best" neighborhood.
We define the "best" neighborhood in Pittsburgh as the safest one because it's reasonable to consider safety as a top priority, especially if you live in or around that neighborhood.
We consider safety to be measured by three different metrics: crime, speeding, and fire incidents.
Crime and traffic incidents are both incredibly common in cities like Pittsburgh, and while fire isn't like the other two, it's still nonetheless incredibly deadly and devastating.
 
In our analysis, we ranked the neighborhoods overall by summing their individual rankings, with the neighborhood with the lowest sum considered to be the "best" neighborhood.
Based on this ranking system, Allegheny West appears to be the "best" neighborhood in Pittsburgh.

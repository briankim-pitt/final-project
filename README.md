### Datasets

Fire Incidents: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/fire-incidents-in-city-of-pittsburgh

In this project, we analyzed WPRDC datasets on the different neighborhoods in Pittsburgh to find the "best" neighborhood. We define the "best" neighborhood in Pittsburgh as the safest one. We consider safety to be measured by three different metrics: crime, speeding, and fire incidents.
 
In our analysis, we ranked the neighborhoods overall by summing their individual rankings, with the neighborhood with the lowest sum considered to be the "best" neighborhood. Based on this ranking system, Allegheny West appears to be the "best" neighborhood in Pittsburgh.

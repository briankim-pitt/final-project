### Datasets

Crime: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data
 
Traffic: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/traffic-count-data-city-of-pittsburgh

Fire Incidents: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/fire-incidents-in-city-of-pittsburgh

In this project, we analyzed WPRDC datasets on the different neighborhoods in Pittsburgh to find the "best" neighborhood. We define the "best" neighborhood in Pittsburgh as the safest one. We consider safety to be measured by three different metrics: crime, speeding, and fire incidents.
 
In our analysis, we ranked the neighborhoods overall by summing the normalized and equally weighted values of crime, speeding, and fire incidents of each neighborhood, with the neighborhood with the lowest sum considered to be the "best" neighborhood. Based on this ranking system, Allegheny West appears to be the "best" neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
